🍄 The Root Domination
==============================
## Global Game Jam 2023 | [Amerike Guadalajara](https://amerike.edu.mx)
> Fungi have been able to communicate in their own language, creating links and being able to communicate with other species. In a world that has lost these connections and is becoming more hostile every day, it is the fungi, these small immobile beings, who have decided to create a change. At first, they can be seen as villains willing to control everything around them, but their mission is to create empathy for all the beings they control, making animals more aware of the other beings around them and how their aggression affects them, thus restoring the links of all the species that have been lost over time, until they reach their goal, the human being.
